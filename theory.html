        <h1>*1D Array:*</h1>
        A 1D array is a linear data structure used to store a collection of elements of the same data type. Elements are accessed using their index. It's a fundamental building block for more complex data structures.
        
        <h1>*2D Array:*</h1>
        A 2D array is an extension of a 1D array, organizing data in rows and columns. It's used for tasks like representing matrices and tables.
        
        <h1>*Linked List:*</h1>
        A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next one. It's efficient for insertions and deletions but less so for random access.
        
        <h1>*Queue:*</h1>
        A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. It's used for tasks like managing tasks in a print spooler or scheduling processes.
        
        <h1>*Searching:*</h1>
        Searching algorithms like linear search and binary search help find elements within data structures efficiently.
        
        <h1>*Sorting:*</h1>
        Sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quicksort, and merge sort arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending.
        
        <h1>*Tree:*</h1>
        A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes. It's used in various applications like hierarchical file systems, decision trees, and more.
        
        <h1>*Graph:*</h1>
        A graph is a non-linear data structure that represents a set of objects with pairwise connections. It's used in social networks, maps, and routing algorithms.
        
        <h1>*Recursion:*</h1>
        Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's often used in data structures like trees and graphs.
        
        <h1>*Stack:*</h1>
        A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. It's used in function calls, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.
        
        <h1>*String:*</h1>
        A string is a sequence of characters. String manipulation and searching are crucial aspects of programming and data processing.
